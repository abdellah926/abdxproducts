    <h1 class="title1">How did my career start? </h1>
    <div class="subtitle1">I started my career five months ago. I know this is very early, especially in web development. Honestly,
         I was very afraid of this field at first, but I gathered courage and said, 'In the name of God,' and started my journey. 
         In these five months, I learned a lot and found myself excelling in it. 
        That's why I will continue until I become a professional in web development, God willing.</div>

        <h2>This is my character.</h2>

    <div class="content1">
        <p>My character, oh, my character. Let's start. My character or myself, I am Abdullah. I love patience, and this is the most
             important thing I want you to know about successful programmers. Patience is the foundation of success and logic. I tend 
             to overthink, and this is what bothers me about my nature because this world is not just about logic; it's also about laughter
              and playing with anything, even if it's rational. I also love tranquility, relaxation, listening to music, and peace of mind, 
              which is the most important thing in life. I love the person who faces problems with reason and not shouting,
             no matter what type. These are my traits, but there are others that you might get tired of reading. The important thing...</p>

    <h1 class="title1">And finally, my dreams.</h1>
    <div class="subtitle1">My dreams, simply put, are to become successful in this field that I love, 
        to fulfill my mother's wishes, to help my father out of his suffering, and most importantly, 
        to have my own gaming room where I can be a gamer. There, anything related to technology will be used. And to become 
        one of the most famous programmers in the world. It's difficult, but God is greater than anything.</div>
